// using React.memo to solve this problem
// when you wrap the component with React.memo then the component will re-render only when the props of the component get change/updated otheewise not.
// Note: if you are sending the function then React.memo wouldnâ€™t save your component to get re-render. Only with the props of the component. for that useCallback hook used as given in this example
